- **How it’s collected:** Only if you grant location permission and press “set location”.

### 2) Name (optional)

## Sharing and third parties
- We do **not** share your personal data with third parties.
- If you choose to use the **Share** feature, the text you share is sent via the app you pick (e.g., WhatsApp, Messages). That sharing is controlled by that third‑party app.

## Data retention
All data is stored locally on your device until you:
- clear the app’s data in Android settings, or
- uninstall the app.

## Security
Your data is stored locally on your device. Android provides platform-level protections (such as device encryption) depending on your device configuration.
